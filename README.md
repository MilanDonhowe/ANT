# ANT
An implementation of the Langston's Ant automata using Python and Tkinter

![An Animated Image of the program running Langston's Ant](readme_images/antboy.gif)

This program was made mostly to refresh some of my knowledge on Python including classes, closures, list comphrensions and command line arguments.

The overall algorithm was derived from the [wikipedia page on Langston's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant).

## Usage
```python ant.py [board size] [square size] [delay in ms] [number of steps of algorithm] ```
